# Probaility vs. Likelihood

quick summary - probability are the areas under a fixed distribution range, likelihoods are the y-axis values for fixed data points with distributions that we can move. OR probaility is predicting new data given a known model and likelihood is fitting a model given some known data

## Probability

Given some distribution of a variable (e.g. a normal distribution) with some min and maximum values, a mean, and standard deviation. we can say that the probability of some randomly selected sample being between x1 and x2 is the area under the curve between the values (i.e. the integral).

So if we have some example of _mouse weights_, with a mean of 32 and a standard deviation of 2.5 and we want to find the probability of the weight being between 32 and 34. we say...

* pr(some observation | parameters) or pr(data | distribution --> (

* "_probability of weight being 32-34 GIVEN (i.e. | ) the mean and standard deviation_"...

* pr(weight 32-34 | mean =32, std = 2.5) = 0.29

## Likelihood

For likelihood, we can assume you have already made your observation (ex. you already weighed the mouse).  And the likelihood is the y-value of the point on the distribution curve (for the example of a normal distribution).

* L(parameters | observation) --> (modify values | fixed value)

* "_likelihood of a distribution of some mean and standard deviation GIVEN (i.e. | ) 34 gram mousee_"...

* pr(mean =32, std = 2.5 | weight=34) = 0.12
